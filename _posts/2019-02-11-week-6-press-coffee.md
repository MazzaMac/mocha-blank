*Info on this week’s Mocha Hotspot: Press Coffee is a fairly inconspicuous little café, despite being positioned on the corner of Buccleuch Street and Buccleuch Place, a.k.a. that really busy bit near the George Square campus of Edinburgh University. That said, it’s never shy of a customer or ten. They serve hot drinks, good cakes, as well as simple breakfast-type foods (bacon sandwich, filled panini, that kinda thang).*

Dicky (you remember him, from Le Bistrot, week 2?) mentioned to me that Press, along with *deep breathe* Thomas J. Walls, Kilimanjaro, Blackwood’s and Wellington, are all part of the same chain within the city. Having been to Thomas J. Walls last week, I figured WHY NOT do a mini series about the entire chain? Plus, Cult Coffee just down the road had no free tables when I went, and Press was the next one I came to on my walk. I’ve been here a couple of times with pals for precious, though often brief catch-ups, so I was keen to give it a proper good sit-in session to really get a feel for the place. Also, I don’t think I’ve ever had a mocha here and looking forward to testing it out. 

There are echoes of T.J. Walls about the place, particularly in the deco-style light fittings, marble table tops and bentwood chairs. But Press has a more modern aspect about it too, found in the abstracted still life paintings that hang on each of the bright, amber-yellow walls. These walls are a nice compliment to the bright blue mug of mocha that floats towards me pretty swiftly after I’ve ordered. It’s heartily sized and has a definite taste of coffee initially, with a lingering flavour of chocolate. This mocha seems to be more of a taste conveyor belt than certain others so far. I’ll confess right here, right now, I’m very into it. 

I’m also really enjoying the fact that there’s an excellent dog with a couple two tables over from me. He’s been a good boy in the extreme since he walked in here. No fuss, just laid right down under the table and accepted the hundred of pats that have been proffered to him by all the other customers. Every week so far, I’ve sort of regretted not bringing my own dog, Chumbo, but in all honesty he just cannot handle mindfulness practice, even though I think he’d benefit from it. He’s a little bag of nervous excitement, especially when he’s out in public and someone new might be willing to cuddle him. 

Maybe it’s the pleasant yellow walls, or the dog, or the fact that I’m feeling better than I have in weeks (yes, I know I’ve really gone on about the ear thing, and I apologise, but it’s been super frustrating), but I feel very calm here in Press Coffee. The logo on the window says “Pause. Press Coffee. Relax”, and I don’t think I’d ever considered the “press” part of the name as a verb. I think somewhere in my mind I imagined a connection between this coffee shop and an old newspaper house? As far as I’m aware, that connection doesn’t exist. I like the idea of a cup of coffee being a pause button for your day though – kinda the point of this blog, innit, lads?

I’ve had a quietly demanding week. My PTSD was triggered for the first time in I-don’t-know-how-many years (I won’t go into the hows or whys; they aren’t necessary to my point), and I found myself hulked over the sink one night, my teeth half-brushed, unable to finish the job because I had such intense nausea. Symptoms of PTSD, for me at least, are strange and unpredictable. Slipping into a moment like this is the closest I’ve ever come to an out-of-body experience, and while I always believed an out-of-body experience would be quite cool and sci-fi, it is, in fact, uncomfortable, frustrating and incredibly stressful. 

BUT! I’ve been reading up on mindfulness of late (figured I should since it’s part of my branding…you’re welcome). I’ve been a fan of Ruby Wax since I was little, and when I realised I’d accrued about a million Audible credits, I downloaded the audio version of her 2013 book Sane New World: Taming the Mind. While I realise some people find Wax abrasive at times, I highly recommend listening to/reading what she has to say. She presents the concept of mindfulness in an accessible, interesting way that is, I think, useful to everybody, no matter the state of their mental health. 

I had been worried I was mis-selling what I’m trying to do here, but, according to Wax, with her masters in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, “[m]indfulness means intentionally paying attention in the present moment, in a non-judgemental way” (I don’t have a page ref, I got it from an audiobook…). So, I think I’m doing it right? I’m going to spend more time reading about the practice, and I want to do some research into the benefits of coffee too, actually. I occasionally worry that I shouldn’t drink it because it increases cortisol, a.k.a. the stress hormone. But right now, there’s nothing more relaxing for me than sitting in these cafés, drinking a sweet, sweet mocha. 

Anyway! This is very long now, so thanks for sticking with it, if you made it this far! Catch you next time, mocha fans ✌
