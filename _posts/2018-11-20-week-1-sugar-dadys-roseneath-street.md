* **Info on this week’s mocha hotspot**: Sugar Daddy’s is an entirely gluten free café, with two branches in Edinburgh. The original Rodney Street branch opened in 2015 after a successful Kickstarter campaign, and the Roseneath Street branch (where I went to for the purposes of this blog) opened earlier this year. Both branches serve a variety of gluten free cakes plus coffees, and there are also some savoury food options at Roseneath Street. There are plenty of other free-from and vegan options too, if you ask staff. I’ve been here once before, for a slightly hungover breakfast and a cappuccino. It was good, so I came back. *

It’s only 3:30pm, but it’s also November, so it’s getting dark. However, Sugar Daddy’s feels at a slight remove from this. The décor is bright and vaguely futuristic. There’s a certain air of the classic American diner about the place, maybe something a bit vapourwave mixed in with that. Like, if the gang from Riverdale came to Edinburgh, they probably wouldn’t mind sitting here, discussing the dark secrets that simmer under the city’s wholesome veneer. I’m alone, but for the staff, now that a young mum, her achingly cute baby and her friend have left. The buzz of the chillers offers enough lowkey white noise to promote a sense of relaxation.

There’s a large neon sign above my head that spells out CAKE in pink tubes. This is part of the sentence “You need CAKE”. And I have it. A gingerbread chocolate brownie. As you can see from the picture below, I forgot that this was a lifestyle blog requiring photographs and took a big bite out of it before I even sat down *insert angel face emoji*. The brownie, in its gluten-free existence, is pretty good. HOWEVER…maybe it’s a little large? Don’t get me wrong, I have, of course, inhaled the entire thing (for the purposes of the review, you understand), but I would have been completely satiated with half. It was a touch on the stodgy side, though the flavour was great, and the tiny gingerbread men made for a pleasant wink towards the miniature, which I always enjoy. 

The mocha itself is, so far, not 100% great. Sometimes, if a mocha isn’t doing it for me, I can slip into a weirdly bad mood. I want a perfect blend of chocolate and coffee. Too sweet and it cloys the tongue, too bitter and it negates the enjoyment of the extra calories that come with the chocolate. This one is more like a very milky hot chocolate with no real hint of coffee flavour whatsoever? But worry not, I’m not in a bad mood, sweet reader. I’m very tired today and I think this is just the comfort I needed, actually. 

When I’m tired I find it hard not to think about death (ooo TWIST!). Is that a normal human reaction? I can never quite tell if what I’m feeling is the same as everybody else in a standard situation. 

Full disclosure (and believe me, this revelation so early in the lifespan of Mocha the Week has come as a surprise to me as much as you, folks, but in the name of openness and honesty, here it goes): I have two older brothers, both of whom are dead. One died twenty years ago this coming February, and the other died ten years ago in September just passed. I have suffered with PTSD, depression and anxiety since I was 11, because of their deaths, one of which was extremely disturbing. I don’t openly speak or write about them very often, or at all really. I have friends who don’t even know they existed, let alone that they died; a fact I am deeply ashamed of.

However, the thesis I ended up writing for my PhD is inextricably connected to them, to their lives and their deaths. And that got me thinking, maybe I can write about these things and people might be interested in reading what I have to say, because…well, I’m not the only person who ever lost someone. I’ve wasted years attempting to suppress my grief, attempting to appear “normal”. It’s exhausting. So, I’m making efforts. Effort to acknowledge their roles in my life. Effort not to feel like a deceitful piece of shit when I pretend everything is, and always has been, fine. Effort to sit with a mocha once a week and think about life; what I have and what I don’t. 

The foam from the milk has dried against the side of my now-empty cup, into patterns that look like ancient cave paintings. That isn’t something anyone was in control of, but I like this fortuitous image in my vapourwave surroundings, this synthesis of the past and the future that I have briefly stumbled on here at Sugar Daddy’s on a dank Tuesday afternoon. It feels pertinent, and it made me smile, so I thought it was worth sharing. Overall, I would say come for the mocha, stay for the chilled-out ambiance? 

(WOAH, things sure did get serious for a second there, riiiiiight? But THAT’S mindfulness, baby! Get used to it. (That last line is partly (mostly) for me.))
