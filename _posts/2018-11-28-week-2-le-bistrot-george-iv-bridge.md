* Info on this week’s mocha hot spot: Le Bistrot is situated within Edinburgh’s French Institute, which recently moved from Queensferry
Road to West Parliament Square. However, I accessed the building from
George IV Bridge and Le Bistrot is RIGHT THERE as soon as you
walk through the door, so that was great. They have a big old menu
covering breakfast, lunch and dinner, and some okay deals on multiple
courses. The wine list is, of course, extensive. I’ve never been here before
and came on the advice of this week’s Mocha Co-pilot, Richard “Dicky”
Duffy. *

Le Bistrot probably would have escaped my attention, were it not for
Dicky’s recommendation. Despite the large sandwich boards and
multiple French flags flying for the Institute, I’m usually so frantic about
being this close to the Royal Mile and the hordes of Edinburgh tourists
that seem to literally float hither and thither about the pavements, there’s
no time to register new coffee spots. I can see why Dicky likes it here,
though. It’s abuzz with various chatters, but it doesn’t feel nearly as busy
as it is. There are plenty of quaint, circular tables with enough room
around them to ensure you’re not sitting in a stranger’s Croque Madame
as you enjoy a leisurely coffee. I want to use the word RUSTIC (or
rustique, since we’re in France), but I think I’m only tending towards that
because there’s half a wall with exposed brickwork; the rest of the place is
pretty clean cut.

The owner is wandering around, speaking what I presume to be very
jolly French affirmations. I can but pray he doesn’t come over to put my
less-than-basic French to the test – while asking for a ham and cheese
sandwich here would be fine, I’m not sure he cares that I play tennis at
weekends…especially since I don’t play tennis at weekends.

Once we’ve ordered (in English), we get to discussing how I might go
about rating the mochas I’m sampling. His first suggestion is consistency,
but I’m a one shot kinda gal…or rather, I’m only doing one coffee place
a week, no repeats and no take backsies. We then decide a sliding scale
from chocolate to coffee is necessary to give a sense of flavour. The
perfect mocha, for me and Dicky at least, would sit somewhere in the
middle of this scale. Size is the final category we talk about; Dicky
believes a smaller mocha will get you more bang for your buck. I’m
inclined to agree, though willing to test the theory. I think I’m also going
to add “drinkability” into the mix – sometimes you get a great-tasting
mocha that you can only really stand for a few sips because it’s too
intense – I want to be draining cups and taking names.

The drinks arrive swiftly; a light brown froth of milk across the wide,
welcoming mugs. These bad boys are large and they’re not messing
around, mate. The waitress puts down some packets of sugar, but as soon
as I take the first sip, it’s clear this mocha isn’t shy of a few grams of the
white stuff. Dicky and I agree, it’s likely to be a chocolate syrup mixed
with the coffee, rather than a powder or actual chunks of chocolate.

This place has a friendliness to it that you don’t always find in city centre
cafés, and the mocha seems to reflect this, if a taste can be considered
friendly? Maybe it’s just because I’m sitting here with my friend, though.
There is a vast range of friendships going on around us, from a very
young baby smiling as a woman waves and pulls a funny face across the
table, to two older women sharing some joke or other that I wish I was
close enough to over here because they are really laughing. There are
also men having friendships with one another, though I feel they are less
vital, so I decline to observe them as carefully. We’ve heard too much
about all-male friendships at this point in our history, haven’t we?

I don’t want to GO ON ABOUT IT, since last week’s emotional
revelation, but! I’ve spent periods of my life feeling extreme loneliness.
Loss can be an isolating experience. I’ve allowed friendships to drift
away, or I’ve made conscious (and, with hindsight, brutal) efforts to end
them because I was living under the misguided impression that “no one
gets it, do they?” Ummm, the only reason it seems like they don’t get it is
because I refuse to admit when I’m struggling, lol? (Just to be clear, I still
don’t tell people, but acknowledging our flaws is how we grow as a
species, right??)

My take home feeling of Le Bistrot and its slightly-too-sweet mocha, is
that friendship is great, and it certainly felt like it was nestled in every
nook and cranny here. Oh, and if you plan on coming here, be aware
that it’s cash only and you might have to speak a little louder if you’re a
woman.
