*Info on this Week’s Mocha Hot Spot: ‘Thomas J. Walls Optician’, the sign reads, but can you get your eyesight seen to here? No, no, no, dear reader. This is just a very hipster rouse, for Thomas J. Walls is indeed a coffee shop. They serve all the coffees (you know the ones), plus hot chocolates, herbal teas, juices and BRUNCH (eggs, bacon, avocado and that).*

I must have walked past this place a thousand times and never really had the desire to go in. Largely because, at least for my first few years here, I genuinely thought it was a jumped-up optician. Then I noticed the chairs and tables through the windows and realised I’d fallen for a wicked, wicked trick. In fairness to the exterior, it does look quite cool, and this continues inside, with vintage décor and styling throughout.  

Service is slow this afternoon, which is slightly annoying because, at £3.40, the mocha here is on the more expensive end of the coffees I’ve tried so far. And it isn’t super busy today. It’s an expansive café though, with plenty of places to sit, though some of the tables seem a bit…plonked? As though they’ve just kinda been tossed down wherever they landed, regardless of the logistics of chair accessibility/human movement. Anyway, I’ve sat myself near the door, behind a wooden partition, because don’t feel like being seen today. On the other side of the partition, there’s a creepy guy and his pal who stared at me the entire time I stood at the counter making my order.

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about that guttural sound Audrey Hepburn makes as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, you know the one? That sort of cat-cry she does whenever ‘Enery ‘Iggins says something dreadful to her? Kinda goes like “Guuuohwaaawhh”? Watch the movie and listen out for it. When I was young I wished she would just shut up with that now! It was too melodramatic for my young ears; I wanted the pleasant lady to come and float about in her organza gowns. But as I’ve grown older I’ve realised that sound is one that haunts my female soul from time to time. It’s the sound of something being squeezed, it is pained and tired; the sound itself wishes it didn’t have to exist. 

The everyday voyeurism of the man behind the partition triggers that sound and makes me feel disgusting. He makes me feel disgusting. The male gaze is completely belittling. And it has set me to distraction today. My skin is itchy, but not scratchy. I can’t stop jiggling my foot, which isn’t natural for me because I hate it when others do it. I want to people-watch and listen in to conversations (as is my usual schtick) but I also want everyone to just SHUT. UP. He’s ruined my mindful intentions, because when I try to look inward to myself in the present moment, I hear the Eliza Doolittle noise and I feel sad.

I’m so caught up being irritated that I’m halfway through my mocha and I’ve forgotten to spend any time evaluating it. So here goes: I would say it’s a dark chocolate hot chocolate with a single shot of espresso in it (I’m used to two), and the fact it was listed under the hot chocolate section of the menu suggests the management sees it this way too. But, unlike say, Lovecrumbs, it tastes more sweet/creamy than outright bitter dark chocolate. It was on the colder side of drinkable when it arrived; not sure if that’s just the temperature they serve at or if it was sat waiting to be served for a couple of minutes (see: slow service, mentioned above). Size-wise, it’s on the larger side of medium. 

There’s something about Thomas J. Walls that’s really off-putting, and I don’t think it’s just the pervy clientele. Could it be the abundance of dark-stained wood and poor lighting? Or the high ceiling that seems to enhance the volume of every conversation and the coffee grinder 1000%? Or the mishmash soundtrack that has absolutely no cohesion and doesn’t suit the interior design at all? Or am I just getting an ear infection*?

It’s getting dark and I don’t feel remotely perked by this mocha. A little toddler just left with her parents and turned around as she went through the door to wave goodbye to everyone. Everyone waved back and said “byeee” in unison, and it made me feel a bit better. 


*Answer: yes, I was, I wrote this 6 weeks ago and had to revisit yesterday to take photos…my feelings about the place were the same, though no obvious voyeurs this time!
